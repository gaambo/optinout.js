## Using the issue tracker

## Adding Code
### Writing Code
We use eslint to lint our JavaScript code. You can find the configuration in `.eslintrc.json` - it's based on the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some modifications.

### Testing
We use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit tests and [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe) for browser tests. 
Please write tests for your code accordingly.

### Branches
We try to base our branch model on the [GitLab Flow Model](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html). 
Please create a new branch for developing new features, adding code, etc. Please use issues, feature-branches and always branch of master / merge into master.

### Pull Requests
You can submit pull requests and our masters will review and merge them if they are fit. Please reference the issue in the commit message.
